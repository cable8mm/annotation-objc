# Annotation for objc

![Resource for annotation](docs/visual-where.png?raw=true)

Annotation means it can be picked up in your drawing, so it can be used in medical labs, hospitals, etc. It has been made for medical resources, especially X-rays.

## Tips

While Swift is the latest programming language, as language versions advance, compatibility issues arise, so it is developed in Objective-C. And the source package is used with CocoaPods.

## Coding style

```sh
find . -name \* -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 clang-format -i
```
